# Hotel-Reservations-Classification-Model

This project focuses on predicting the booking status of hotel reservations, 
given a set of features that describe guests' reservations.

I solved this problem using multiple models and chose the one with the highest accuracy. 
I applied some feature engineering to the model, which improved its accuracy.

I built a final prediction function that is ready to take any new data aligned with the dataset provided and, 
using the full model pipeline, return the final prediction output.

After that, I deployed this model using Flask by creating a simple web application to take all data 
from the user and then give the final prediction as an output based on the data entered.
