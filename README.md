# Hotel-Reservations-Classification-Model

This project focuses on predicting the booking status of hotel reservations, 
given a set of features that describe guests' reservations.

I applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore the data and extract insights.

I addressed this problem using multiple models and selected the one with the highest accuracy.
I applied feature engineering to the model, which improved its accuracy.

I built a final prediction function that is ready to take any new data 
aligned with the provided dataset and, using the full model pipeline, 
return the final prediction output.

Afterward, I deployed this model using Flask by creating a simple web application 
that takes all data from the user and then provides the final prediction based on the entered data.

Finally, I published the model from localhost to a server using PythonAnywhere.
